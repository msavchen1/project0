# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project 0 consists of the webpage GeoXplore of imaginary travel agency “GeoXplore” in country of Georgia, which provides various guiding tours (hiking, gastronomy and city/historical tours). this website provides quick introduction of how  the travel agency’s website could be organized.
For Project 0 I used following pages:
1. index.html - Home page
It utilized @media, id, class, multiple CSS selectors and buttons for navigation to other .html and brief introduction for potential clients.
2. services.html - webpage where potential clients can get to know the availability of the tours.
It uses the style sheet from Bootstrap and grid system for differentiating 3 cards with tours and installed pictures.
3. pricelist.html - gives a grid system of prices for services provided during tour guiding
Page uses stylesheet from Bootstrap 4 as well as @media, when web page gets smaller than 1000 and 980px respectively, background image changes and footer goes down.
4. about.html - gives brief description of the members of the GeoXplore
Uses stylesheet in compiled file button.scss, where the inheritance applied to three buttons
5. button.css - compiled file of button.scss with inheritance.
6. contact.html - provides contacting information.
uses form and scss file for building up table and asking for email if potential clients or prospective works want to gain more information.
7. contact.css - stylesheet with nesting for file contact.html
8. construction.html - a page which is used to some of the buttons in previously mentioned pages which still will be developed in future.
